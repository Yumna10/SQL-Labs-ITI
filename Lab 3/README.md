# Lab 3 – SQL Practice: DDL, DML, and DQL

## Overview
This lab focuses on practicing SQL through three major types of queries:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)** – Creating a new database and tables for a hospital system.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – Inserting and updating records in the `Company_SD` database.
- **DQL (Data Query Language)** – Retrieving meaningful insights from the `Company_SD` database.

The goal is to reinforce understanding of SQL syntax and how to manipulate and retrieve data effectively in real-world business and healthcare scenarios.
